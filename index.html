1. The **Will** of God [(v3-6a)](# "ref")
1. Our **Identity** in Christ [(v6b-8)](# "ref")
1. From Selfishness to **Service** [(v9-12)](# "ref")

For this is the will of God, your **sanctification**:<br>

1. **Flee** Immorality 
2. Honour God with Our Own **Bodies**
3. Honour **Others**

[1 Thessalonians 4:3a (ESV)](# "ref")
>>>
+ "sanctif": God **makes** us holy: not
  + stand far off, **demand** we be holy,
+ but HS **dwells**: why **deemed** holy.
  + So live **worthily** of that calling.
+ God's **will** for us regarding sex,
  + in 3 **commands** *(infinitives)*:
+ **Flee** sexual immorality
+ Honour God with our own **bodies**
+ Honour God in our rl w/**others**

>>>
+ What do we **mean** by "sex immoral"?
+ Some cultures: only **adultery**
  + Or **prostit** (xch sex for money)
  + Or pedophilia + sexual **slavery** 
    + (**coercion** of w/less power)
+ e.g., **Spartans**: strict on adultery 
    + but open w/homosexuality
+ But God's truth like **bullseye**:
  + **many** wrongs, only 1 **truth**
+ Creator **design** sex rl w/in **marr**:
  + 1M1F, lifelong **covenant** eq partner
+ So sex immor is anything **not** that
+ **gas** good for cars, but only if in
  + gas **tank**, acc to **design** engine
+ Hold **true** to God's design
  + **Run** away from any off bullseye
+ 1Cor6 expands on this:

**Flee** from sexual immorality.<br>
Every other sin a person commits <br>
is **outside** the body,<br>
but the sexually immoral person <br>
sins against his **own body**.

[1 Corinthians 6:18 (ESV)](# "ref")

>>>
+ Christ paid greatest **price** to redeem
  + So we **belong** to Him: 
  + spirit, heart, mind, and **body**
+ Set apart as place where HS **dwells**
+ But don't I have **freedom** to
  + do what I **want** with my own body?
+ 2nd **command** in v4:

---
<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://sermons.seanho.com/img/bg/unsplash-cpyEmA5b6EI-dancers.jpg" -->
that each one of you know how to<br>
**control** his own **body** <br>
in **holiness** and **honor**,

[1 Thessalonians 4:4 (ESV)](# "ref")
>>>
+ "control": acquire for self, **possess**:
  + both **ownership** and responsib
+ But "It's my body, my **choice**!"
  + Yes, but what will I **do** w/choice?
+ But "**consenting** adults: not your biz!"
  + Yes, **necess**: but not **suff**
+ "body": vessel w/purpose, **utility**
+ Purpose: for "**holiness** + honour"

[1 Thessalonians 4:5 (ESV)](# "ref")
[Francesco Ungaro](https://unsplash.com/photos/7A_yfNw528g "caption")

+ "passion": pathos, deep **emotion**

  + ignores all other considerations
  + (always **bad** in Bible!)
+ Ppl of **world**: w/o God's **law**
  + so just try best, **"good"** person
+ Only has vague aphorisms like
  + "Just be true to **yourself**" 
  + "Just follow your **heart**"
+ Result: do what comes **naturally**:
  + i.e., indulging **sinful** nature
+ But we must stay **centred** God's law
  + Last **command** in v6:

so that Satan may not **tempt** you <br>
because of your lack of **self-control**.

[1 Corinthians 7:5b (ESV)](# "ref")
>>>
+ **Coercing** sex is aggression, so also
