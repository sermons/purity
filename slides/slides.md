  + Or pedophilia + sexual **slavery** 
    + (**coercion** of w/less power)
+ e.g., **Spartans**: strict on adultery

+ But God's truth like **bullseye**:
  + **many** wrongs, only 1 **truth**
+ Creator **design** sex rl w/in **marr**:

<!-- .slide: <%= bg("unsplash-Apj4nSemkzk-running_feet.jpg") %> -->
**Flee** from sexual immorality.<br>
Every other sin a person commits <br>
is **outside** the body,<br>

sins against his **own body**.

你們要逃避淫行。<br>
人所犯的，無論甚麼罪，都在身子以外，<br>
惟有行淫的，是得罪自己的身子。
