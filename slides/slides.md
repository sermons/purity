+ The effects can range from the seemingly **harmless**: 
  + e.g., indulging in **porn** / fantasy
+ to serious issues that **hurt** how we **see** or interact with others:
  + e.g., seeking **revenge** (e.g., harming another's reputation)
  + because they won't give us **attention** in the way we want
+ to **actions** with long-term repercussions: 
  + e.g., extra-**marital** sexual relations
+ Sexual **desires** are powerful forces:

  + or pedophilia + sexual **slavery** 
    + (**coercion** of those with less power)
