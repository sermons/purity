For this is the will of God, your **sanctification**:<br>
that you **abstain** from **sexual immorality**;

[1 Thessalonians 4:3 (ESV)](# "ref")
>>>
+ "sanctification": He **is** our holiness
  + not: God stands apart, **demands** we be holy,
  + but: HS **dwells**, is why we're deemed holy:
+ so live **worthily** of that calling
+ "sexual immor": from antiquity, incl **various** practises
+ diff **cultures** considered diff practises "immoral":
  + **adultery** (extra-marital affairs)
  + **prostitution** (exch. sex for money)
  + pedophilia + sexual **slavery** (coerce those w/less power)
  + **Spartans** strict on adultery but open w/homo
+ Truth as **bullseye**: many diff ways to be wrong
  + Creator's **design**: sex in **marriage**:
  + 1M1F equal partnership for life
+ God sanctifies us, **defines** immorality vs holiness
  + so "abstain": **hold apart**, keep away from

---
that each one of you know how to<br>
**control** his own **body** <br>
in **holiness** and **honor**,
[1 Thessalonians 4:4 (ESV)](# "ref")
>>>
+ "control": acquire for oneself, possess: ownership, responsibility
  + "my body, my choice"
+ "body": vessel, utility: body, wife
+ "holiness + honor": not that body is dirty/shameful

not in the **passion** of **lust**<br>
like the Gentiles who do not know God;
[1 Thessalonians 4:5 (ESV)](# "ref")
>>>
+ "passion": pathos, deep emotion (not necc bad)
+ "lust": inflamed, consuming desire that ignores all other considerations (bad)
+ w/o God's law to keep us centred,
  + try best to be "good"
  + "true to self" / "follow heart": what comes naturally: indulging sinful nature

---
that no one **transgress** and **wrong**<br>
his brother in this matter,
[1 Thessalonians 4:6a (ESV)](# "ref")
>>>
+ "transgress": overstep bounds, defraud
+ "wrong": have more / desire more: covet, take advantage of
+ 2 appl: if brother is struggling with controlling own body
  + do not take advantage / belittle
+ for myself: be warned, sex imm not "victimless":
  + indulging in lust is selfish
  + even if only fantasy / escape
+ steps over bounds God drew for how to treat others
  + pornography (written or visual) encourages objectification of others
  + see others only as tool to satisfy own lust
+ Not only impacts relationships w/others
  + Also hurts ourselves:

---
**Flee** from sexual immorality.<br>
Every other sin a person commits <br>
is **outside** the body,<br>
but the sexually immoral person <br>
sins against his **own body**.
[1 Corinthians 6:18 (ESV)](# "ref")
>>>
+ Christ paid the price to redeem us
  + We belong to Him: spirit, heart, mind, body
  + To be a place where HS dwells
+ So no, I do not have the freedom to do what I want w/own body

---
because the Lord is an **avenger**<br>
in all these things,<br>
as we told you beforehand<br>
and solemnly warned you.
[1 Thessalonians 4:6b (ESV)](# "ref")
>>>
+ "avenger": comes forth from justice, carries out judgment:
  + champion / defender of city
+ What is the Lord defending?
  + holiness of our bodies whom He redeemed
  + honour + value of others whom we would objectify

For God has not called us for impurity,<br>
but in holiness.
[1 Thessalonians 4:7 (ESV)](# "ref")
>>>
+ "impurity": uncleanness
  + "holiness": set apart w/ special identity + purpose
+ "called": God knows you, sees you, calls you

---
Therefore whoever **disregards** this,<br>
disregards not **man** but **God**,<br>
who gives his **Holy Spirit** to you.
[1 Thessalonians 4:8 (ESV)](# "ref")
>>>
+ sounds very severe + strict, perhaps feel unreasonable
+ if these were man-made rules, we'd say to the men:
  + "you cannot keep these yourself" (probably repressed)
  + simply means to control / belittle others
+ but these are set by our Creator who designed bdy
  + and redeemed it to be dwelling for HS
+ don't "disregard" (set aside, deem irrelevant / inapplicable)

---
you yourselves have been<br>
**taught by God** to **love one another**,<br>
for that indeed is what you are doing<br>
to all the brothers throughout Macedonia.

  + but by HS dwelling within them,
  + prompting them to show love to others
+ did not wait for Paul/others to prompt them
+ extended love within church at Thes
  + and outward to sister churches in area

---
But we urge you, brothers, <br>
to do this **more and more**, <br>
and to aspire to live **quietly**,<br>
and to mind your **own affairs**,<br>
and to work with your **hands**, <br>
as we instructed you,
[1 Thessalonians 4:11 (ESV)](# "ref")

+ "mind own affairs": practise (make habit) one's own: process
  + concern for others should not be excuse to neglect own responsibilities
+ "work w/hands": labour to accomplish: "I made that"

---
so that you may <br>
**walk properly** before outsiders<br>
and be **dependent** on no one.
[1 Thessalonians 4:12 (ESV)](# "ref")
>>>
+ "walk": walk around (in circles): daily conduct
