# Opening <br> **Question**
<!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

---
For this is the will of God, your sanctification:<br>
that you abstain from sexual immorality;
>>>
+ "sanctification": holiness, not that God stands apart and demands we be holy,
+ but HS dwells in us, is the only reason we are deemed holy:
+ so live worthily of that calling
+ "sexual immorality": from antiquity, encompassing various practises
+ diff cultures considered diff practises "immoral":
  + adultery (extra-marital affairs)
  + prostitution (exch. sex for money)
  + pedophilia + sexual slavery (coercion of those with less power)
  + Spartans strict on adultery but open w/homosexuality
+ truth is like bullseye: many different ways to be wrong
  + Creator's design: sex in marriage: 1M1F equal partnership for life
+ God sanctifies us, defines immorality vs holiness

---
4 that each one of you know how to<br>
control his own body in holiness and honor,
>>>
+ "control": acquire for oneself, possess: ownership, responsibility
  + "my body, my choice"
+ "body": vessel, utility: body, wife
+ "holiness + honor": not that body is dirty/shameful

---
5 not in the passion of lust<br>
like the Gentiles who do not know God;
>>>
+ "passion": pathos, deep emotion (not necc bad)
+ "lust": inflamed, consuming desire that ignores all other considerations (bad)
+ w/o God's law to keep us centred,
  + try best to be "good"
  + "true to self" / "follow heart": what comes naturally: indulging sinful nature

---
6 that no one transgress and wrong<br>
his brother in this matter,
>>>
+ "transgress": overstep bounds, defraud
+ "wrong": have more / desire more: covet, take advantage of
+ 2 appl: if brother is struggling with controlling own body
  + do not take advantage / belittle
+ for myself: be warned, sex imm not "victimless":
  + indulging in lust is selfish
  + even if only fantasy / escape
+ steps over bounds God drew for how to treat others
  + pornography (written or visual) encourages objectification of others
  + see others only as tool to satisfy own lust
+ Not only impacts relationships w/others
  + Also hurts ourselves:

---
Flee from sexual immorality.<br>
Every other sin a person commits is outside the body,<br>
but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.
[1 Cor 6:18 (ESV)]
>>>
+ Christ paid the price to redeem us
  + We belong to Him: spirit, heart, mind, body
  + To be a place where HS dwells
+ So no, I do not have the freedom to do what I want w/own body

---
because the Lord is an avenger<br>
in all these things,<br>
as we told you beforehand<br>
and solemnly warned you.
>>>
+ "avenger": comes forth from justice, carries out judgment:
  + champion / defender of city
+ What is the Lord defending?
  + holiness of our bodies whom He redeemed
  + honour + value of others whom we would objectify

---
7 For God has not called us for impurity,<br>
but in holiness.
>>>
+ "impurity": uncleanness
  + "holiness": set apart w/ special identity + purpose
+ "called": God knows you, sees you, calls you

---
8 Therefore whoever disregards this,<br>
disregards not man but God,<br>
who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
>>>
+ sounds very severe + strict, perhaps feel unreasonable
+ if these were man-made rules, we'd say to the men:
  + "you cannot keep these yourself" (probably repressed)
  + simply means to control / belittle others
+ but these are set by our Creator who designed bdy
  + and redeemed it to be dwelling for HS
+ don't "disregard" (set aside, deem irrelevant / inapplicable)

---
you yourselves have been<br>
taught by God to love one another,<br>
10 for that indeed is what you are doing<br>
to all the brothers throughout Macedonia.
>>>
+ care for fellow believers in Christ, exhibited in action + gifts
+ taught not by inner conscience
  + but by HS dwelling within them,
  + prompting them to show love to others
+ did not wait for Paul/others to prompt them
+ extended love within church at Thes
  + and outward to sister churches in area

---
But we urge you, brothers, to do this more and more,<br>
11 and to aspire to live quietly,<br>
and to mind your own affairs,<br>
and to work with your hands, as we instructed you,
>>>
+ increase in love for fellow believers
+ "aspire": love what is honourable, zealously pursue that which has great personal value
  + deem this as honourable/worthy, and enjoy pursuing it
+ "live quietly": be silent, still, opp. restless, raucous, draw atten to self
+ "mind own affairs": practise (make habit) one's own: process
  + concern for others should not be excuse to neglect own responsibilities
+ "work w/hands": labour to accomplish: "I made that"

---
12 so that you may walk properly before outsiders<br>
and be dependent on no one.
>>>
+ "walk": walk around (in circles): daily conduct
+ "properly": good schema / form: respectable, becoming
  + outward appearance (God knows heart)
+ "dependent": have need of no one
